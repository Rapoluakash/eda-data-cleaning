## üìå Project Highlights

- üì• Load and explore raw data (Excel format)
- üßº Handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent formatting
- ü™™ Rename and structure columns for clarity
- üìä Generate insights using summary stats and visualizations
- ‚úÖ Output a clean, analysis-ready dataset

## üõ† Technologies Used

- Python 3.10
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- OpenPyXL (for reading Excel files)
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## üìÅ Files Included

- `weight-predictor-app.py` ‚Äì Main notebook containing all EDA steps
- `requirements.txt` ‚Äì Python dependencies
- `Rawdata.xlsx` ‚Äì (Not included in repo due to size/privacy, but expected format documented)

### ‚úÖ Tips:
- Add a **`preview.png`** or chart image to make the repo visually appealing.
- Replace `your-username` in the clone link with your actual GitHub username.
- Let me know if you want help generating visuals or a matching `LICENSE`.

Want me to drop this into a file for you or prep your GitHub repo structure too?
